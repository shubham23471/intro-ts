let myname = "Bob" // will show type as string 
const myName2 = "Bob" 
// there it will not show type as string but show the "Bob" 
// and this is called a Literal type
// this is when we tell TS that the varible is not a generic type like string 
// but instead is Literal Type. An actual value type of this string "Bob"


// This concept is mostly used with a concept called Unions
